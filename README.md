## Alias library for using the DOM API

Domali is nothing like jQuery. When you make a call with domali, you are calling the dom natively, so you will still be working with `NodeLists` and `HtmlCollections`, just like you would with the dom.

### Install

- `jspm install npm:domali`

```javascript
    import dom from 'domali'
```
